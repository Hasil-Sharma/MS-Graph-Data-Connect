# Onboarding to private preview

2. Log in with that demo admin account at <https://portal.azure.com>.
3. Open the Subscriptions blade. Select Add.

8. Send us the Subscription ID from step 5 and the Directory ID from step 7.

9. The features will be enabled in 1-2 weeks and you will receive a communication from us about the same.

Once you receive communication from us, you need to turn on couple of knobs.

## Enabling Tenant Lockbox

1. **Use Internet Explorer/Edge for this step**. Download the Microsoft Exchange Online PowerShell module following [these instructions](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt775114(v=exchg.160).aspx)

2. Open the installed Microsoft Exchange Online PowerShell module.

3. Login:

```powershell
Connect-EXOPSSession
```

4. You will have to set up an approver group as part of the flow, with **at least two** members in the group to approve data access requests. More info on the command is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/users-and-groups/new-distributiongroup?view=exchange-ps). 

```powershell
New-DistributionGroup -Name "TenantLockboxApprovers" -Members "chris@contoso.com,michelle@contoso.com,laura@contoso.com,julia@contoso.com"
```

5. Turn on Tenant Lockbox.
   > **NOTE:** "TenantLockboxApprovers" in the below command refers to the name of approver group created in step 4.

```powershell
Enable-ElevatedAccessControl -AdminGroup "TenantLockboxApprovers" -SystemAccounts @()
```

6. Set up an approval policy.

   > **NOTE:** Set -ApprovalType to `Manual` if you want to experience Office365 Admin consent flow of approving the data pull requests from Office365. Set it to `Auto` if you are using a test tenant and don't want to manually approve your pipelines every time you do a new deployment during your development phase.
   >
   > We make new requests only when you create/modify a pipeline, we don't create new requests for every pipeline runs.
```powershell
New-ElevatedAccessApprovalPolicy -Task 'Office365\Data Access Request' -ApprovalType Manual -ApproverGroup "TenantLockboxApprovers"
```
